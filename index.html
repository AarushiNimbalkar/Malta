                <h3>Valletta (or Il-Belt) is the tiny capital of the Mediterranean island nation of Malta. The walled city was established 
                     the 1500s on a peninsula by the Knights of St. John, a Roman Catholic order. It‚Äôs known for museums, palaces and grand 
                     churches. Baroque landmarks include St. John‚Äôs Co-Cathedral, whose opulent interior is home to the Caravaggio masterpiece 
                     "The Beheading of Saint John".</h3>

                     <h3>Valletta's 16th-century buildings were constructed by the Knights Hospitaller. The city was 
                     named after Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege
                     of Malta. The city is Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture, though the 
                     Second World War left major scars on the city, particularly the destruction of the Royal Opera House. The city was officially
                     recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.The city has 320 monuments, all within an area of 0.55 square kilometres
                     (0.21 sq mi), making it one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world. Sometimes called an "open-air museum",
                     Valletta was chosen as the European Capital of Culture in 2018. Valletta is also the sunniest city in Europe.</h3>
